#Write a Python program that computes the net amount of a bank account based a transaction log from console input. #The transaction log format is shown as following: #D 100 W 200 (Withdrawal is not allowed if balance is going negative. Write functions for withdraw and deposit)  D means deposit while W means withdrawal


balance=0
def deposit():
    global balance
    d=int(input("enter the amount to be deposited: "))
    balance=balance+d
def withdrawal():
    global balance
    w=int(input("enter the amount to be withdrawn: "))
    if balance>w:
        balance=balance-w
        print("withdrawal successful")
    else:
        print("insufficient balance to withdraw")

    opt=int(input("give your operation : 1;deposit,2;withdrawal: "))
    if opt==1:
        deposit()
